### First make an http request of the POST verb:

```
http://localhost:7000/
```

(Do this so that quotes are created in the database.)

### To make queries to the API use the following url:

```
http://localhost:7000/quotes?page=0
```

(Then define the page number, if it is "0" it means that it is the first page.)
